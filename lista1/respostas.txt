1. Explique em que situa¸c˜oes a representa¸c˜ao de ponto flutuante de um n´umero fl(x) resulta em um
valor maior que x nos computadores modernos, considerando representa¸c˜ao double.

R: Some numbers cannot be represented exactly. One reason for this is that some rational numbers - those that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers - may have repeating, infinite length mantissas when expressed in binary. For instance, the number 1/3 = .333333… has such a mantissa in base 10. (We denote this .3 to show that the digit 3 repeats infinitely.) Expressed in binary, 1/3 = .010101… = .01 . Thus, in either system, representation of 1/3 in scientific notation with a fixed number of bits results in some loss of accuracy. The number 1/10 = .0011 in binary and 1/20 = .00011, whereas 1/10 = .1, 1/20 = .05 in decimal.

Computing systems may use various methods for accounting for lost bits - in particular "truncation" or "rounding". For instance, with rounding, the lost bits in the representation of 1/10 are rounded up, but the lost bits in the representation of 7/10 are rounded down. Either case results in a loss of accuracy. See below:

0.1 : 0 01111011100 11001100110011001101
0.7 : 0 01111110011 00110011001100110011


The 32nd bit in the representation of 0.1 should be 0, but the bits that follow and are lost are 1100 and get rounded up. The 32nd bit in the representation of 0.7 is properly 1, but the bits that follow and are lost are 0011 and get rounded down.
